## DSA Review
- Graphs:
    - Are similar to a network and show connections between nodes (vertices) via edges
    - Used to show networks, 'friendships' (facebook), google maps
    - Graphs encompass trees (trees are a type of graph and graphs are a type of tree)
    - Directed graphs:
        - Show flow - movement is not bidirectional
        - Similar to facebook friends (you have to accept a friendship to be connected)
    - Undirected graphs: 
        - Is bidrectional
        - Similar to twitter (you can follow someone but they may not follow you)
    - Cyclic:
        - When you can go to all nodes
        - Common in weighted graphs
    - Acyclic:
        - There is no path to all nodes
    - Graphs are built on top of other data structures:
        - Similar looking to linked lists and trees 
    - 3 ways to build:
        - Edge graph:
            - An array that states connections
        - Adjacency list:
            - Index is the node and the value is the nodes neighbours
            - Can use linked lists, graphs, arrays
        - Adjacent matrix:
            - Having 0's and 1's indicating whether or not the node has a connection to another
            - It is arrays within an array or an object
