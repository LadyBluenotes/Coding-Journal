## DSA Review
- Binary Heaps
    - Every child is lower than the the parent or "root" node
    - Lookup is O(n)
    - Insert and delete is O(log n)
    - Used in data storage priority due to sorting algorithms
    - Add values from left to right and then bubbles up
    - Not unbalanced
    - Flexible size
    - Fast insertion
    - 
    - Gotcha = memory heaps
        - Region in our storage that stores arbitrary data
    - Priority Queue:
        - Where each piece element has a priority and elements of higher priority are served before elements of lower priority
            - Ex. a line up where VIP's who may show up later can get let in before those in the general line
- Trie
    - Specialized tree used in searching (mostly text)
    - Can outperform hashtables, binary search trees, and other data structures
    - Also called a prefix tree
    - Used in searching words in a dictionary, providing auto selections, etc
    - Big O = O(length (of word))
    - Good at memory storage (you don't have to store letters multiple times for words with similar prefixes)
