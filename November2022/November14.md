## DSA Review
- Array Review:
    - Best served with looking up and push/pop
    - Arrays are ordered
    - They don't work well with searching, inserting or deleting.
    - If using a fixed array, size can be an issue.
- Hash tables:
    - Objects in JS (can also be called dictionaries, maps, hashes)
    - Use hash functions which are functions that generate a value of a fixed length for each input that it gets and leads you to a memory address.
        - Hashing only goes one way (idemponent) and always outputs the same thing
    - Hashtables are O(1) for insert, lookup, delete and search.
    - Hashtables are not ordered (objects in JS are, however)
    - Collisions are when 2 keys are put in the same bucket:
        - Can solve with linked lists
    - JS has maps and sets
        - A map allows you to save any data type as a key
        - Sets only let you store keys, no values
    - Set and get methods:
        - Set is adding something into the hashtable
        - Get is retrieving something from the hashtable (typically the value of the key you are searching)
