## DSA Review
- Started a DSA course on udemy to create some structure with this subject.
- Good code must be readable and scalable.
    - Big O helps measure how scalable code is.
- O(n) is the equivalent to linear time (usually one loop runs in O(n) time)
- O(1) is called constant time (no matter how large the input is, there is only one output (ex: a console log))
- For best practices, drop the constants that are involved in figuring out the big O notation (we don't need to see O(n+1000) we can write O(n))
- Use different terms for inputs (ex, if there are 2 for loops, they would be different constants O(n+m) vs O(2n) due to different inputs)
- Loops that are within each other (nested loops) are always multiplied (therefore nested for loops are O(n^2) or quadratic time)
- O(log n)
