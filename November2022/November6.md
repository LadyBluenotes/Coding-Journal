## DSA Review
- When looking for unique characters or counting how many characters are within a sentence, hashmaps can be quite useful.
    - They let you use key-value pairs to count how many characters are present within a sentence.
    - They allow you to check to see if you have already found the present letter.
    - Hashmaps allow for quicker search, insertion and deletion - all working within O(1) space and time and, paired with a loop to add into the hashmap, it leads O(n).
    - Using this can prevent usage of nested for loops which can lead to O(n^2) time or.

## What I Learned
- `praseInt()` will parse a string argument and return an integer or NaN
- `String()` will convert whatever is passed in, into a string.
- `object.hasOwnProperty(key)` will return a boolean that tells you if whatever is passed through is located within that object (key-value pair)
    - can also check with `object['key']` or `object.key`

#### Tomorrow's Goals
- Do minimum 2 leetcode mediums with strings.
- Do minimum 2 codewars 6kyu with strings.
