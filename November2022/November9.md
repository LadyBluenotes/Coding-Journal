## DSA Review
- When trying to determine time complexity consider the following:
    - How many times are you looping over the problem (if once = O(n) if a nested loop = O(n^2))
    - If you aren't doing any loops and only one step is required, time will be O(1)
    - If you are doing a divide and conquer method, it will take you O(log n) because the increase in time decreases as input increases
        - Good for large data sets.
    - O(n!) is the highest - this would include nested for loops with every element
- Big 0 always considers worst case scenario

## What I Learned
- Review helped me to solidify my knowledge of the valid 2 leetcode review questions - was feeling tired so I respected that and avoided approaching mediums when they were causing frustration.

#### Tomorrow's Goals
- Work on some leetcode mediums
