## DSA Review
- Graphs:
    - To add a vertex, you add the node to the adjacency list object with an empty array as there are no connections to start
    - To add an edge for an **undirected** graph, you have to push to both nodes' array to show that they are connected
    - Graphs show relationships but scaling is difficult
- Algorithms are steps in a process that we take to perform a desired action with computers:
    - Perform actions on adata
    - Many different types
    - Simplify big O complexity for some problems
- Recursion:
    - More of a concept than an algorithm
    - When you define something in terms of itself (a function that refers to itself inside a function)
    - Stack overflow:
        - When you call the maximum call stack size 
        - Infinitely calling a function without an exit strategy 
    - A base case is required to avoid hitting stack overflow (must be returned to exit out of loop)
    - Have 2 paths:
        - Recursively calling the function
        - Exit case
    - 3 rules:
        - Find base case
        - Find recurisve case
        - Get closer and closer and return when needed (usually 2)
