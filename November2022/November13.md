## DSA Review
- Reference (non-primitive type: created by programmer):
    - Objects, arrays are reference types.
- Context:
    - Scope is created with curly braces (`function a() {let a=10}`)
- `This` refers to the object you are inside of.
- Instantiation describes the creation of an object.
- String questions tend to be array questions as they can be split into an array
- Two pointer method (basic explanation)
    1. Have to declare right and left variables
    2. Create a while loop that will continue so long as a condition is true but making sure that you ensure there will be no infinite loop
    3. Enter conditions required for sort in the function body
        - Make sure to increment or decrement the right and left counters so that the conditions will eventually be false

## Codewars && LeetCode Done

### Easy - Leetcode
**1. Two Sum**
**217. Contains Duplicate** /Review again/
**283. Move Zeroes** /Review again/
**344. Reverse String**

## Medium - Leetcode
**49. Group Anagrams** /Reviewed/
**53. Maximum Subarray** /Review again/
**189. Rotate Array** /Review again/
**347. Top K Frequent Elements** /Review again/

## What I Learned
- Always check input of question - could be empty or if the appropriate input
- Strings can be accessed as arrays - can access via loops

#### Tomorrow's Goals
- Review questions 
- Start next section of DSA course
