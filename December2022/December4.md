## DSA Review
- Insertion Sort:
    - Useful in times when you're sure the list is sorted
        - Best case scenario is O(n)
    - Works well in *small* data sets
- Merge Sort:
    - Uses divide and conquer method.
        - Works on subsets of the array.
    - O(n log n) for time complexity
    - Divide the array into its singular bits then you put pairs back together until they are sorted, then you proceed to add the other elements to each pair, one by one, and sorting as you go.
    - One of the most efficient ways of sorting.
    - Still have to compare all numbers.
    - Uses recursion

## Codewars && LeetCode Done
**912. Sort an Array**

## What I Learned
- Insertion sort will time out on larger data sets as it would take too long to process due to the O(n) time complexity.
- Small data sets or data sets that are nearly sorted would be best with insertion sort as it is quite quick.
